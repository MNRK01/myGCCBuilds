 1) Download the release and master from https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads
 2) Unzip mingw-std-threads-a.b.c.zip into C:\Software\mingw-std-threads-a.b.c
 3) Download the utility_scripts from the github master as mingw-std-threads-master.zip and unzip to a subfolder under C:\Software\mingw-std-threads-a.b.c
 4) Edit Generate-StdLikeHeaders.ps1 in C:\Software\mingw-std-threads-a.b.c\utility_scripts to change '$gcc.WaitForExit()' to '$gcc.WaitForExit(20000)'
 5) Start an admin Powershell prompt
 6) `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` to allow Powershell scripts to be executed
 7) `Get-ExecutionPolicy` to confirm status
 8) Check %PATH% with `$env:Path`
 9) `$env:Path="C:\Software\msys64\mingw32\bin;$env:Path"` to add gcc to the $env:Path. The specific gcc does not matter since
    the path to the built-in gcc include dirs will be removed from the generated headers to make packaging with my gcc builds
    easier. The built-in headers are always included, so there is no need to keep reincluding them! To verify the include path
    for a gcc: `printf '#include <thread>\n\n' > test.cpp` and `cpp -v test.cpp > test.cpp.txt` and inspect the output for the
    included directories search order.
10) Verify that any gcc is on %PATH% with `$env:Path` and `g++ -v`. This is necessary to generate the <thread>, ... headers
11) `cd C:\Software\mingw-std-threads-a.b.c\utility_scripts\`
12) If the ps1 script hangs than enable debugging with `Get-PSDebug` and `Set-PSDebug -Trace 1`
13) `.\Generate-StdLikeHeaders.ps1 -Interactive`
    Folder for generated headers: `..`
    Folder for gcc: <Enter>
    Folder for mingw-std-threads headers: <Enter>
    Folder for wrapper batch script for g++: <Enter>
14) Verify that C:\Software\mingw-std-threads-a.b.c contains generated <thread>, <mutex>, <shared_mutex>, <future>, <condition_variable> headers.
    The output from Generate-StdLikeHeaders.ps1 currently lists that 5 headers are generated. Verify this.
15) Edit the generated <thread>, ... headers to remove any hard paths to the mingw-std-threads headers. e.g.
    #pragma once
    #include "..\..\..\lib\gcc\i686-w64-mingw32\9.3.0\include\c++\thread"
    #include ".\mingw.thread.h"
16) Create a folder with the original file structure at C:\Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-orig
17) Create a diff file for easy patching of the i686 mingw-std-threads version in the future. Do not recurse into irrelevant directories. You will need to edit the gcc version in the patch.
    `diff -uN /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-orig /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c > ~/Scripts/mingw-std-threads-i686-w64-mingw32-930.patch`
18) Use sed to generate a diff file for easy patching of the x86_64 mingw-std-threads version in the future.
    Generate x86_64 version patch.
    `sed -e 's/i686/x86_64/' mingw-std-threads-i686-w64-mingw32-930.patch > mingw-std-threads-x86_64-w64-mingw32-930.patch`
    Generate x86_64 and future gcc version patch.
    `sed -e 's/i686/x86_64/' -e 's/9.3.0/10.0.0/' mingw-std-threads-i686-w64-mingw32-930.patch > mingw-std-threads-x86_64-w64-mingw32-1000.patch`
19) Patch mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-orig to test the generated diff file
    `patch -uN --dry-run --verbose -d /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-i686/ < ~/Scripts/mingw-std-threads-i686-w64-mingw32-930.patch`
    `patch -uN --dry-run --verbose -d /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-x86_64/ < ~/Scripts/mingw-std-threads-x86_64-w64-mingw32-930.patch`
20) Copy the generated headers to the appropriate gcc folders - NECESSARY for win32-sjlj or win32-seh builds, optional for posix-sjlj and posix-seh builds
    /home = /c/Software/gcc-build/msys64/home
    `mkdir /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/i686-930-posix-sjlj-rt_v7-rev0/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `cp -ip /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-i686/* /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/i686-930-posix-sjlj-rt_v7-rev0/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `mkdir /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/i686-930-win32-sjlj-rt_v7-rev0/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `cp -ip /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-i686/* /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/i686-930-win32-sjlj-rt_v7-rev0/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `mkdir /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/x86_64-930-posix-seh-rt_v7-rev0/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `cp -ip /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-x86_64/* /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/x86_64-930-posix-seh-rt_v7-rev0/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `mkdir /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/x86_64-930-win32-seh-rt_v7-rev0/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `cp -ip /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-x86_64/* /home/arkay7777/mingw-gcc-9.3.0/x86_64-930-win32-seh-rt_v7-rev0/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    OR
    `mkdir /c/Software/msys64/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `cp -ip /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-i686/* /mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `mkdir /c/Software/msys64/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
    `cp -ip /c/Software/mingw-std-threads-a.b.c-x86_64/* /mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads`
21) Open mintty with the appropriate gcc win32 build on the path. Note that CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are gnu make environment variables that
    may not be recognized by the direct invocation of gcc or by alternate build systems such as boost b2.exe. Use CPATH to pass flags to gcc directly.
    `export CFLAGS="-I/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads" and `echo $CFLAGS`
    `export CXXFLAGS="-I/mingw32/opt/include/mingw-std-threads" and `echo $CFLAGS`
    OR
    `export CFLAGS="-I/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads" and `echo $CFLAGS`
    `export CXXFLAGS="-I/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads" and `echo $CFLAGS`
    OR
    `export CPATH=/mingw64/opt/include/mingw-std-threads` and `echo $CPATH`
